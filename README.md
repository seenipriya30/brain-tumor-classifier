# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using SVM

This machine learning project uses an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier with GridSearchCV to detect brain tumors from MRI images.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `brain_tumor_detection.ipynb` – Main notebook with code and results
- Dataset: MRI brain scan images categorized into "Tumor" and "No Tumor"

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of brain tumors is critical. This project applies machine learning to automate the detection of tumors from brain MRI images.
